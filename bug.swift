let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

let sum = numbers.reduce(0, +)

print(sum) // Output: 15

//This code snippet works perfectly fine if all the numbers in the array are positive. However, if there is a negative number, it might lead to unexpected behavior.  For example:

let numbers2 = [1, 2, -3, 4, 5]

let sum2 = numbers2.reduce(0, +)

print(sum2) // Output: 9

//The issue is not immediately apparent; however, it's an edge case that highlights potential issues with using the '+' operator directly inside reduce without carefully considering data types and handling possible edge cases.  While this example is simple, more complex scenarios may hide unexpected behavior.  For instance, if numbers represent floating point numbers, precision errors due to accumulated rounding might appear over many iterations.
